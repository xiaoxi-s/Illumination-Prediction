# Illumination-Prediction

## Setup Tutorial

Note that the setup would also be applicable for the project. The steps would be generally the same. 

### Dependencies

 - conda
 - Python3.7
 - pytorch

### Steps

  - See this [link](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/). Remeber to add Anaconda to my Path
  - Create virtual environment under the project directory using `conda create --prefix ./venv python=3.7`
  - Activate the virtual environment using `conda activate ./venv` under your project folder
  - Install pytorch using command line in this [document](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Check that the installation is successful.
  - Build your Convolutional Neural Network according to this [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html)
  - Done! 

## Reproduce Paper
